  <h3 id="grants">2.1. Grants</h3>

  <p>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive license:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <p>under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
      Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
      modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="effective-date">2.2. Effective Date</h3>

  <p>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
  become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
  distributes such Contribution.</p>

  <h3 id="limitations-on-grant-scope">2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</h3>

  <p>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
  this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
  distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
  Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
  Contributor:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <p>for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
      or</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
      modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
      Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
      Version); or</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
      its Contributions.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
  or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
  notice requirements in Section 3.4).</p>

  <h3 id="subsequent-licenses">2.4. Subsequent Licenses</h3>

  <p>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
  distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
  (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
  under the terms of Section 3.3).</p>

  <h3 id="representation">2.5. Representation</h3>

  <p>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
  Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
  grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</p>

  <h3 id="fair-use">2.6. Fair Use</h3>

  <p>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
  applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
  equivalents.</p>

  <h3 id="conditions">2.7. Conditions</h3>

  <p>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
  in Section 2.1.</p>

  <h2 id="responsibilities">3. Responsibilities</h2>

  <h3 id="distribution-of-source-form">3.1. Distribution of Source Form</h3>

  <p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
  terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
  of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
  they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
  restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.</p>

  <h3 id="distribution-of-executable-form">3.2. Distribution of Executable
  Form</h3>

  <p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <p>such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
      Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
      the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form
      by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the
      cost of distribution to the recipient; and</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
      License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
      license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
      recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="distribution-of-a-larger-work">3.3. Distribution of a Larger
  Work</h3>

  <p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
  Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
  with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
  Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
  You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
  such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
  their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
  either this License or such Secondary License(s).</p>

  <h3 id="notices">3.4. Notices</h3>

  <p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
  (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
  limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
  Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
  extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</p>

  <h3 id="application-of-additional-terms">3.5. Application of Additional
  Terms</h3>

  <p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
  Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
  of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
  warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
  alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
  disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
  jurisdiction.</p>

  <h2 id="inability-to-comply-due-to-statute-or-regulation">4. Inability to
  Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</h2>

  <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
  judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
  this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
  limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
  text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
  this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
  such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
  skill to be able to understand it.</p>

  <h2 id="termination">5. Termination</h2>

  <h3>5.1.</h3>

  <p>The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
  if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
  compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
  Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
  ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
  non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
  come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies
  You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time
  You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
  Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
  of the notice.</p>

  <h3>5.2.</h3>

  <p>If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
  and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
  indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
  all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
  shall terminate.</p>

  <h3>5.3.</h3>

  <p>In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
  end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
  have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
  prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>

  <h2 id="disclaimer-of-warranty">6. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>

  <p><em>Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,
  without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
  including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
  of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
  The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
  is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
  You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
  part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under
  this License except under this disclaimer.</em></p>

  <h2 id="limitation-of-liability">7. Limitation of Liability</h2>

  <p><em>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or
  anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to
  You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages
  of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits,
  loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have
  been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of
  liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury
  resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law
  prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
  limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and
  limitation may not apply to You.</em></p>

  <h2 id="litigation">8. Litigation</h2>

  <p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
  courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place
  of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
  jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
  in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or
  counter-claims.</p>

  <h2 id="miscellaneous">9. Miscellaneous</h2>

  <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
  necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
  the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
  be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</p>

  <h2 id="versions-of-the-license">10. Versions of the License</h2>

  <h3 id="new-versions">10.1. New Versions</h3>

  <p>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
  10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
  publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
  distinguishing version number.</p>

  <h3 id="effect-of-new-versions">10.2. Effect of New Versions</h3>

  <p>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
  of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
  under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
  steward.</p>

  <h3 id="modified-versions">10.3. Modified Versions</h3>

  <p>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
  create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
  version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references
  to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified
  license differs from this License).</p>

  <h3 id=
  "distributing-source-code-form-that-is-incompatible-with-secondary-licenses">
  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
  Licenses</h3>

  <p>If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
  notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.</p>

  <h2 id="exhibit-a---source-code-form-license-notice">Exhibit A - Source
  Code Form License Notice</h2>

  </blockquote>

  <p>If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file
  in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such
  a notice.</p>

  <p>You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.</p>

Unity Technologies ApS (“Unity”) grants to you a worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, and royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative
works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute the software that
accompanies this License (“Software”), subject to the following terms and
conditions:

1. Unity Companion Use Only. Exercise of the license granted herein is limited
to exercise for the creation, use, and/or distribution of applications,
software, or other content pursuant to a valid Unity content authoring and
rendering engine software license (“Engine License”). That means while not
limited to exercise in the software licensed under the Engine License, exercise
may not be for any purpose other than the creation, use, and/or distribution of
Engine License-dependent applications, software, or other content. No other
exercise of the license granted herein is permitted, and in no event may the
Software be used for competitive analysis or to develop a competing product or

the license granted herein modifies the Engine License in any way.

3. Ownership; Derivative Works.

3.1 You own your content. In this License, “derivative works” means derivatives
of the Software itself--works derived only from the Software by you under this
License (for example, modifying the code of the Software itself to improve its
efficacy); “derivative works” of the Software do not include, for example,
